        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem 
            Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
             unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen 
             book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic

       <div class="col-md-4"><h3>exmanple! item2</h3>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader 
        will be distracted by the
         readable content of a page when looking 
         at its layout. The point of using 
         Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
         normal distribution of letters, 
         as opposed to using 'Content here, content 
         here', making it look like readable
          English. Many desktop publishing packages
           and web page editors now use Lorem 
        
        and the like).</p></div>
       <div class="col-md-4"><h3>example! item3</h3>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
            Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
           
             .</p>
